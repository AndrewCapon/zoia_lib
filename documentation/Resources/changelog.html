<p>1.13 ( August 25, 2020 )</p><p>---------------------</p><p>- New Features:</p><p>  - MIDI Notes: As requested, Round-Robin style output has been added and can</p><p>    be selected by setting the priority option to RoundRobin. Selecting this</p><p>    option will increment the output that a MIDI note is assigned to,</p><p>    restarting at the first available output once the last output has been</p><p>    reached. </p><p>  - MIDI Notes: The scale has been expanded from the previous A0 to A10 range</p><p>    to include notes as low as C-2. The previous CV values are unchanged, notes</p><p>    below A0 will produce negative CV values. </p><p>  - MIDI Notes: sending a midi all notes off message to the channel assigned in </p><p>    the module options will turn all notes off. The can be used as a panic </p><p>    message to release gates that get stuck high. </p><p>  - MIDI Clock Out: New module added under the interface modules category. </p><p>    The clock CV input can be set to tap tempo or CV control and will send </p><p>    midi clocks at 24 Pulses Per Quarter Note (PPQN). The CV triggered </p><p>    running output will send the appropriate start/continue or stop command, </p><p>    and display the last command sent. The reset output will send a stop command</p><p>    and set the song position to 0. Send/song position can be used to set</p><p>    playback to a specific location in the song. </p><p>  - MIDI Clock In: Added a new option to select from a small range of</p><p>    multipliers. </p><p>  - MIDI Pitch Bend: As requested, a MIDI pitch bend module has been added.</p><p>    Set the channel from the module options and a CV value will be generated </p><p>    from incoming pitch bend messages. </p><p>  - Tap to CV: New module added under the control modules category. Create a </p><p>    CV value from the tap input (as requested, thanks Christopher Jacques). </p><p>  - Clock Divider: The divisor and dividend can be changed individually to a </p><p>    value in the range of 1 to 32, allowing for significantly more modifier </p><p>    values (as requested, thanks Christopher Jacques). Clock Dividers loaded </p><p>    from patches saved on older firmware will continue to show the single </p><p>    modifier input. </p><p>  - Clock Divider: Added an option to set the input clock with a CV value.</p><p>  - Added BPM/frequency/period views for the clock divider input view.</p><p>  - Clock Divider modules will now save the last recorded frequency </p><p>    when a patch is saved, and new clock dividers initialize high- </p><p>    similar to current tap-controlled LFO behaviour. </p><p>  - LFO: An additional choice has been added to the control option to allow for </p><p>    linear CV control (as requested, thanks Christopher Jacques).</p><p>  - ADSR: Added an option to switch to linear time CV control </p><p>    (as requested, thanks Christopher Jacques).</p><p>  - Firmware files in the root directory of the SD card can be ignored by</p><p>    navigating to the configuration options (gear icon) and selecting the</p><p>    'Hide Firmware?' option. This will modify the name of any files that</p><p>    begin with 'ee' by prepending the file name with an underscore. </p><p>  - The installed firmware version will be displayed for a short period of time</p><p>    when the pedal boots.</p><p>  - Added a screen-saver that comes on after 1 hour. Pressing any button or </p><p>    turning the rotary encoder will wake the screen back up.</p><p>  - Performance Mode: As requested, performance mode will prevent new </p><p>    connections or deleting existing module. Activate performance mode by </p><p>    pressing shift + back while on the home screen for the currently loaded </p><p>    patch. The back button LED will illuminate magenta to indicate it is active.</p><p>- Bug Fixes:</p><p>  - ADSR module: The attack phase will now end when the output reaches the </p><p>    maximum CV value.</p><p>  - ADSR gate input will now show negative CV values.</p><p>  - ADSR retrigger will now always return to 0 before restarting the </p><p>    attack phase (thanks Christopher Jacques).</p><p>  - MIDI Clock In: The 'running out' parameter was changed to go low when a </p><p>    MIDI Stop message is received, and go high when a MIDI Start or Continue </p><p>    message is received. Receiving a MIDI Clock message without a start or </p><p>    continue message will no longer cause this parameter to go high.</p><p>  - Starred List: Removing starred parameters would sometimes cause the pedal </p><p>    to crash. </p><p>  - Fixed a bug that was occasionally causing the rotary encoder to skip </p><p>    movements.</p><p>  - Fixed several screen related bugs.</p><p>  - Added drift compensation to the LFO and Clock Divider modules. </p><p>  - CV Value Module: pressing the rotary knob and turning to fine-tune CV bias </p><p>    values will no longer switch the view type.</p><p>  - LFO Module: changing BPM values will now quantize to whole steps.</p><p>  - Modules saved with mangled names should now load with default names.</p><p>  - Delay Line Module: negative CV values should no longer cause the rate to </p><p>    max out. </p><p>  - CV Delay Module: negative CV values will show correctly at the input.</p><p>  - Sample and Hold will now load with the previously held value, display </p><p>    negative CV values at the input, and the output value will reflect the same </p><p>    CV seen at the input (thanks, Christopher Jacques).</p><p>  - Cab Sim Module: The channel option for single input, two outputs has been </p><p>    fixed (thanks, Christopher Jacques).</p><p>  - Compressor Module: External sidechain fixed for stereo mode.</p><p>  - MIDI Program Change: An incorrect patch would sometimes load </p><p>    instead of the intended one. </p><p>    </p><p>1.12 ( May 20, 2020 )</p><p>-----------------------</p><p>- Added hardware version for Blackhorn 05 board, so manufacturing could</p><p>  continue and hashes could be added to edat.</p><p>1.11 ( April 15, 2020 )</p><p>-----------------------</p><p>- New Features:</p><p>- Bug Fixes: </p><p>  - All triggered CV jacks have been reverted to pre-1.10 behaviour. Adding a </p><p>    small threshold value proved to be too disruptive to current patches. </p><p>  - A bug where copying pages between patches would cause a crash has been </p><p>    fixed.</p><p>  - Using the shift key while naming modules, patches, or pages was causing</p><p>    all input characters to be capital letters. The shift key will now </p><p>    toggle lower-case and upper-case input (thanks Christopher Jacques).</p><p>  - Copying modules would cause some options to break when trying to change </p><p>    them, such as the colour of the copied module. </p><p>  - Pitch Shifter Module: Reduced the level of audio being processed by pitch </p><p>    shifters. Patches containing pitch shifters created on older firmware will</p><p>    still exhibit old behavior; replace the pitch shifters on current firmware </p><p>    and save the patch to fix audio levels. </p><p>  - UI button module was missing a description for the colours added in 1.10.</p><p>  - Resolved text issues when importing empty pages.</p><p>  - A SD card error message will be sent to the screen if attempting to create </p><p>    a new folder</p><p>    without a SD card inserted.</p><p>  - Fixed screen issues that would occasionally occur when viewing starred </p><p>    settings.</p><p>1.10 ( February 28, 2020 )</p><p>--------------------------</p><p>- New Features:</p><p>  - Extended Colours: The number of colours that ZOIA can display has</p><p>    doubled! Set colours when creating or editing a module, or use the</p><p>    new colours with the ui button module by changing the colour option.</p><p>  - CV Value module functionality: note and frequency parameters can</p><p>    be used when a CV value module is set to negative to one range.</p><p>    Negative CV input will output a negative CV equivalent in value to</p><p>    what the positive input would produce, but with the opposite sign</p><p>    (as requested, thanks Christopher Jacques).</p><p>  - MIDI Consume: New option added to the configuration menu allows the</p><p>    user to set some, all, or none of the MIDI messages received by ZOIA to</p><p>    be consumed. The default behavior to consume some MIDI messages implies</p><p>    that if a module uses a MIDI message received by ZOIA that it will be</p><p>    consumed and not passed to MIDI out. Consuming all MIDI messages will</p><p>    effectively disable MIDI Thru, while consuming none of the message will</p><p>    pass both used and unused messages to MIDI out.</p><p>- Bug Fixes:</p><p>  - Making connections between modules was not always working</p><p>    (thanks Christopher Jacques).</p><p>  - Patch Delete: Deleting a patch would keep appending the patch number</p><p>    to the deletion message (thanks Ante).</p><p>  - Moving a patch was displaying the message for copying a patch.</p><p>  - CV displays: the precision of cv values should be more consistent</p><p>    between input and output jacks.</p><p>  - Page Importing: Importing pages was putting modules on the wrong page.</p><p>  - Quantizer: Some quantized values were incorrect for certain scales</p><p>  - MIDI: Song Position Pointer was not getting sent</p><p>  - VCA Module: Fades for VCA modules have been reduced.</p><p>  - CV modules that trigger are less sensitive to very small changes. </p><p>    Triggering these modules will now require exceeding a minimum threshold </p><p>    value. </p><p>1.09 ( November 29, 2019 )</p><p>--------------------------</p><p>- New Features:</p><p>  - Oscillator Module: CV values between -1 and 0 connected to the</p><p>    input jack will result in frequencies from 0.027 Hz to 27.49 Hz</p><p>    (as requested, thanks Christopher Jacques).</p><p>  - The CV control for various modules will now show more points of precision</p><p>    (as requested, thanks Christopher Jacques).</p><p>  - Pitch Detector: Rotary switch will toggle the output display between</p><p>    note and frequency.</p><p>- Bug Fixes:</p><p>  - UI Button: Buttons with multiple connections were sometimes behaving</p><p>    unexpectedly (Thanks Christopher Jacques).</p><p>  - Page Importing: Importing pages could cause modules to get pushed beyond</p><p>    the last page and corrupt the patch (Thanks Christopher Jacques).</p><p>  - Patches with large numbers of certain modules, such as the multi-filter,</p><p>    were loading over the processor limit and getting disabled until a module</p><p>    was deleted. The initial loading tolerance has been increased.</p><p>  - Pitch Detector: Connecting a high frequency audio signal was causing</p><p>    the pedal to freeze.</p><p>1.08 ( November 07, 2019 )</p><p>-------------------------</p><p>- Bug Fixes:</p><p>  - Page Importing: Selecting an empty patch to import pages from</p><p>    was crashing the pedal.</p><p>  - Page Importing: Selecting the current patch to import pages from will</p><p>    no longer advance to page selection.</p><p>  - Sequencer: One-Shot behaviour was not holding the last step as intended</p><p>    (thanks Christopher Jacques).</p><p>  - Sequencer: will once again load without a current step and advance to the</p><p>    first step on first gate input pulse.</p><p>  - Module Options: Pressing a button while Module Options is open will change the position</p><p>    of a new module, or do nothing for an existing module. The selection cursor</p><p>    will no longer return to the top in either case.</p><p>  - Copying Patches: The screen interface was sometimes freezing during copy.</p><p>    (thanks Vinicius Nisi).</p><p>  - Vibrato Module: Negative CV values connected to the width jack</p><p>    was causing distorted audio. (thanks Vinicius Nisi).</p><p>  - Effect Modules Mix Control: negative CV values connected to the mix control</p><p>    of effect modules such as Flanger, Phaser, and various reverbs, were causing the</p><p>    mix to become more wet. Setting the mix control to 0 will only output a dry signal.</p><p>    (thanks Vinicius Nisi).</p><p>  - Ghostverb Mix: Saving the Ghostverb module mix at 0 would cause the module to</p><p>    load with a wet mix. It will now initialize as the correct dry mix on patch load.</p><p>    (thanks Vinicius Nisi).</p><p>  - Ghostverb Options - Channels: Changing a Ghostverb module to 1in-&gt;1out was sometimes</p><p>    emitting high-pitched feedback.</p><p>  - Delay with Mod / Ping Pong Delay modules: Adding a stereo delay while a mono delay</p><p>    exists in the patch would cause the pedal to crash. (thanks Stepan).</p><p>  - Delay with Mod / Ping Pong Delay modules: Tap tempo would start to cause glitched</p><p>    audio if the delay times were too high or too low. The maximum and minimum delay</p><p>    time that can be set is now consistent with the manual control (thanks Steve).</p><p>  - Pitch Detector: Improvements made when tracking pitch.</p><p>1.07  ( October 10, 2019 )</p><p>-----------------------</p><p>- New Features:</p><p>  - Functionality for Importing pages between patches added.</p><p>    Pressing the page right or left button will load the page list,</p><p>    where the first option in the list will allow selection of a</p><p>    patch and the pages to import.</p><p>  - Looper has 32 second option for length (thanks Gariel Tanaka).</p><p>  - 1 Buffer Delay has been renamed Buffer Delay and can now be used to set</p><p>    a delay of 1 to 16 buffers from the module options (thanks Christopher Jacques).</p><p>- Bug Fixes:</p><p>  - delay w/mod and pingpong delay's modulation now working properly at</p><p>    slow rates (thanks Herman Carvahlo).</p><p>  - Sequencer will initialize to step 1 on patch load (thanks Stephen Davidson).</p><p>  - Sequencer track output text will change on rotary press when graph view is enabled.</p><p>  - Clock divider reset jack will not arm automatically (thanks Philipp ZÃ¼rcher).</p><p>  - Various text issues fixed (thanks Christopher Jacques).</p><p>  - Changing pages while viewing a jack connection list will change the</p><p>    page button LEDs to yellow.</p><p>1.06 ( October 07, 2019 )</p><p>-------------------------</p><p>- Hardware Update</p><p>- Bug Fixes:</p><p>  - Factory presets can be loaded from the configuration options again</p><p>  - All starred settings with assigned MIDI CCs are savable</p><p>    and will now load correctly (thanks Ziv Eliraz).</p><p>1.05  ( July 30, 2019 )</p><p>-----------------------</p><p>- New Features:</p><p>  - Patches can now be loaded to and from ZOIA by selecting from a list of</p><p>    folders found on the SD card. The patch transfer options can be found in</p><p>    the configuration menu as &quot;Patches to SD&quot; and &quot;Patches from SD&quot;. When</p><p>    transferring patches to the SD card (from ZOIA) there will be an option to</p><p>    create a new folder on the SD card; when transferring patches from the SD card</p><p>    (to ZOIA) a backup folder will be created on the SD card. A limit of 64 folder</p><p>    options can be shown, and number of backup folders are limited to 256.</p><p>    ( as requested, thank you Brock Davisson ).</p><p>- Bug Fixes:</p><p>  - Sequencer tracks will output the correct track type.</p><p>  - Sequencer Ratchet is CV controllable ( thank you Mitch ).</p><p>  - Sequencer connections to steps will only affect the first output track.</p><p>  - When in one-shot mode, the output tracks were outputting the CV value</p><p>    corresponding to step 1; outputs are now disabled after completion.</p><p>  - Module names will now correctly show the default name if no name is given.</p><p>  - Navigating to the configuration menu will always load with the first</p><p>    option selected</p><p>  - Clock Divider learned how to divide a little better (thanks Christopher Jacques).</p><p>    Additionally, the output range can be changed in the module options.</p><p>  - Looper module transitions between play and record are now more reliable</p><p>1.04  ( June 27, 2019 )</p><p>-----------------------</p><p>- New Features:</p><p>  - Modules can be renamed when they are created or edited. Thanks Brian H,</p><p>    Gabriel Tanaka, and everyone else in the community that provided input.</p><p>- Bug Fixes:</p><p>  - Loading a corrupt preset would hang the pedal at startup.</p><p>  - Looper module going to wrong state when switching states quickly with Lfo.</p><p>    (thanks Willem Zenhorst)</p><p>  - 'DSP Usage' menu no longer exceeds 64 items and text issues are fixed.</p><p>    (thanks Michael Moger)</p><p>  - Quantizer module key and scale text now use an alphabet known to Earth.</p><p>    (thanks Willem Zenhorst)</p><p>  - Moving a patch will no longer reload a patch.</p><p>1.03  ( May 31, 2019 )</p><p>----------------------</p><p>- New Features:</p><p>  - Granular module in audio section (as requested, thank you Ben Norland).</p><p>  - Added an option to the Quantizer module allowing control over the key and scale.</p><p>    (thanks Hopeful Utopian)</p><p>  - Audio Input/Output switches have a default fade time; added an option to</p><p>    turn fades off. (thanks Cuckoo)</p><p>  - Added an option to the Delay Line module where interpolation can be turned off,</p><p>    bringing a single Delay Line module down from 6% CPU usage to %4.7. Useful if</p><p>    the delay time wont be changing on the fly (thanks Cuckoo).</p><p>  - Updated automatic version detection system used for internal inventory</p><p>    tracking system.</p><p>- Bug Fixes:</p><p>  - Quick fades were sometimes happening quicker than intended.</p><p>  - The Midi Clock module no longer requires a start command; it now runs when</p><p>    a midi clock is received.</p><p>  - Patches saved with Audio Input/Output Switches set to ch.1 were not initializing</p><p>  - Audio Mixer pan controls were causing problems with audio out, such as complete</p><p>    loss of audio (thanks Christopher H M Jacques).</p><p>  - You can now use more than one Audio Balance module without having them break</p><p>    each other (thanks Christopher Jacques).</p><p>  - Fixed a Starred settings bug where a jack with a starred connection was removed</p><p>    with module option change, but the starred list wasn't updated.</p><p>1.02 ( May 16, 2019 )</p><p>---------------------</p><p>- New Features:</p><p>  Looper Additions: (thanks Matthew James)</p><p>  - The goal was to have the looper act the same as it did before with the same</p><p>    options enabled, so existing patches using the looper shouldn't be broken.</p><p>  - added overdub option. When enabled a reset button is added. Hitting record</p><p>    starts recording the loop, hitting it a second time sets the loop end point</p><p>    and immediately starts overdubbing (if play-&gt;loop option is enabled). Hitting</p><p>    it a third time it goes from overdubbing to playback.</p><p>  - added a play/stop button option. Hitting it while playing stops playback,</p><p>    hitting it again resumes playback at the current location.</p><p>  - Reset button clears the loop, and puts it in a stopped state ready to start</p><p>    recording again.</p><p>  - If you overdub at a speed greater then 100% you'll see the cpu go up by a</p><p>    few percent, something to keep in mind.</p><p>  - The initial loop is always recorded as if the speed is set to 100%. The</p><p>    overdubs get scaled with pitch (ie if you record an overdub at speed 200%</p><p>    and then change the speed to 100%, the overdub will get pitched down an</p><p>    octave).</p><p>  - The play, record, and reset buttons are always green, red, and yellow</p><p>    respectively.</p><p>  - The text on the buttons now shows the state as p, r, od for the playing,</p><p>    recording, overdubbing along with the position in the loop.</p><p>  Starred Settings Midi CC Control:</p><p>  - When in the starred settings window you can hit 'shift + star' again</p><p>    and it will show midi cc's assigned to each starred parameter. You can</p><p>    modify the list. Also, if you turn to the left while editing there's a</p><p>    learn option which will assign the CC to the next CC that is received by</p><p>    the pedal.</p><p>  - You set which midi channel the pedals listens for starred CC's in the</p><p>    config menu.</p><p>- Bug Fix: External normally closed stompswitch now works correctly. (thanks Kyle Sim)</p><p>- Bug Fix: in switch module had issue causing crash.</p><p>- Bug Fix: jack names not correct after editing modules in some cases.</p><p>1.01 (Beta Date: April 26, 2019)</p><p>--------------------------------</p><p>- New Module: Midi Clock In. ZOIA will now receive midi clock from a</p><p>  another device (thanks Adam Jensen)</p><p>- Optimization: around 8-10% less CPU usage for intense patches due</p><p>  to better memory allocation.</p><p>- Optimization: around 30% less CPU usage on the chorus and flanger effects.</p><p>- New Feature: Added square wave waveform to tremolo. (thanks Matthew James)</p><p>- New Feature: MIDI bypass toggle. Send value 64 to CC#60 to toggle ZOIA.</p><p>  (thanks Adam Jensen)</p><p>- New Feature: Added 'DSP Usage...' option under the config menu. Shows RAM</p><p>  usage, DSP used by the matrix to send signals around, etc, and the usage</p><p>  of individual modules in your current patch.</p><p>- Bug Fix: midi program change freezing pedal when parameter is selected.</p><p>  (thanks Paul Priest).</p><p>- Bug Fix: freeze (from stack overflow) sometimes occurring when copying</p><p>  pages. (thanks Mitch Lantz)</p><p>- Bug Fix: list item index incorrect when jumping between two connection list</p><p>  screens (thanks Cuckoo).- Fixed list item index incorrect when jumping between two connection list</p><p>  screens (thanks Cuckoo).</p><p>- Bug Fix: unit freezing when going over 100% processor usage. It now stops</p><p>  processing the last module added, and the 4 buttons that show the bypass</p><p>  state go yellow to show you it's time to delete a module or two.</p><p>- Bug Fix: yellow buttons showing a possible connection staying yellow when</p><p>  switching patches.</p><p>- Bug Fix: midi channel not updating properly from changes in config menu.</p><p>1.00 ( April 6, 2019 )</p><p>----------------------</p><p>- changed the way PIC sends button information to Blackfin. Should</p><p>  fix the hanging shift and connections bug.</p><p>0.20 ( Apr 5, 2019 )</p><p>------------------</p><p>- added help functionality for modules, buttons, and module options.</p><p>- fixed major bug with module copy, which could lead pedal to hang.</p><p>- looper module functionality improved and bugs fixed.</p><p>- updated some module button naming to be more consistent.</p><p>- may have mitigated the bug where the ZOIA thinks a button is held down</p><p>  (ie connections are made inadvertently, config menu opens when it</p><p>  shouldn't, etc.)</p><p>0.19 ( Mar 29, 2019 )</p><p>---------------------</p><p>- transferring patches to/from SD is now done through the config menu.</p><p>- updated delay w/mod effect to make the modulation sound better.</p><p>- fixed delay w/mod effect right side wet not working.</p><p>- made ping pong delay true stereo.</p><p>- fixed a bug with the keybaord displaying weird not values at output.</p><p>- made patch copy quazi-non-destructive. It now shifts the presets up</p><p>  when copying a patch, so the last patch (63) would get deleted.</p><p>- fixed bug with category names displaying with random characters at the end.</p><p>- fixed bug with mixer set to stereo, no panning working in mono rather then</p><p>  stereo.</p><p>- updated the init_code, so the the firmware booting/loading bug should</p><p>  be fixed (hopefully!).</p><p>- made connection strength a percentage by default for cv (still dB for audio).</p><p>- implemented random button functionality in very basic form (randomly changes</p><p>  parameters and cv connection strengths in a patch).</p><p>0.18 ( Mar 17, 2019 )</p><p>---------------------</p><p>- new 'pixel' module. a single cv input button who can turn completely off.</p><p>- ui button module now goes completely dark.</p><p>- changed pushbutton to be just one single button.</p><p>- audio mixer with panning on and stereo off options now mixes mono inputs to a</p><p>  stereo output, with the panning controls.</p><p>- fixed scrolling issue. when you enter screens it's no longer scrolling like crazy.</p><p>- balance, switched up the naming and operation to make more sense ( I think).</p><p>- fix config: start preset only going to 62.</p><p>- fix problem with many modules recalling correctly with buttons saved with</p><p>  value of 0.</p><p>- delay module: made minimum delay time 1 sample.</p><p>- added confirmation to page delete.</p><p>- 'move page x before' text not cutoff anymore.</p><p>- fixed a bug with preset zipping/un-zipping.</p><p>- added patch move capability. It's non-destructive, just changes the</p><p>  order of the patches).</p><p>- cv value module now shows a variety of different formats (number, frequency,</p><p>  musical note)</p><p>- added a trigger output to the keyboard module.</p><p>- made it easy to change what the default options for a module are without</p><p>  screwing up people's patches. changed delay line max delay time to 1 second.</p><p>- changed sequencer CV step to show musical note instead of number by default.</p><p>- moving some modules around in the list.</p><p>- made config-&gt;autoshift default back to off. Having it on is too confusing for</p><p>  beginners.</p><p>- changed trigger outputs to exponentially decay, making them easier to see.</p><p>  Patches that depend on the shape of a trigger output will be affected by this.</p><p>- switched around the ramp and sawtooth definitions in the LFO. Won't affect</p><p>  patches. Now ramp angles up and sawtooth angles down.</p><p>0.17 ( Mar 8, 2019 )</p><p>----------------------</p><p>- fixed the firmware loading/booting bug from 0.16 (I think).</p><p>- added basic functionality of starred settings list.</p><p>- updated df1 filter name to multi-filter.</p><p>- changed schroeder apf name to diffuser.</p><p>- made config-&gt;autoshift default as on.</p><p>0.16 ( Mar 4, 2019 )</p><p>----------------------</p><p>- added room reverb.</p><p>- added random waveform to LFO.</p><p>- renamed some modules: cv noise-&gt;random, cv autotune-&gt;quantizer, cv</p><p>  quantizer-&gt;steps, sampler-&gt;looper. Dropped 'cv' from the name of other</p><p>  modules.</p><p>- fixed bug with ghost resonance.</p><p>- fixed bug with LFO tap time saving.</p><p>0.15 ( Feb 28, 2019 )</p><p>-----------------------</p><p>- added reverb lite. Uses about 10% mono, 12% stereo.</p><p>- added Schroeder apf.

So you'll have to set this option again</p><p>    in your patches.</p><p>- you can now move patches while in the patch list. It won't insert, it will overwrite. (thanks Evan)</p><p>- updated clock divider module to allow for all divisions and multiplications from 1 to 32. added</p><p>  reset jack.</p><p>- pitch shifter: you can now click the rotary to adjust by semitones and cents</p><p>- fixed bug with copying pages with empty names leading to funny characters</p><p>- top utility buttons now go yellow when you have a button selected and move to another page, to</p><p>  warn you that you could potentially be making a connection</p><p>- oscillator: fm input and duty cycle input works a little better now.</p><p>- oscillator: adding upsampling option to decrease aliasing</p><p>- lfo: you can click the rotary encoder while on the frequency</p><p>- trying an experimental way of generating audio waveforms in the oscillator. more efficient, less aliasing.</p><p>  you may hear discontinuities in the frequency spectrum when moving the frequency around slowly. does</p><p>  it sound good or bad? To lessen them, you can turn on the oversampling.</p><p>- LEDs now dim when you are renaming something so that you can read the damn letters!</p><p>- you can now delete connections from the connections list</p><p>- fixed bit crusher so it no longer mutes audio when sending in negative cv. added option for</p><p>  fractional bits</p><p>- df1 filter Q scale is now exponential.</p><p>- keyboard and sequencer can now switch between music notes and cv with a rotary switch press</p><p>- you can now &quot;save as&quot; with the rotary encoder. (thanks Pauline)</p><p>- fixed bug with copying white modules causing invisible modules (thanks Evan)</p><p>- after deleting a patch from the patch list, the patch list is now updated appropriately.</p><p>- fixed audio mixer. the mix knob was working the wrong way around.</p><p>- cleaned up cv input and output switch. increased max number of inputs/outputs to 16.</p><p>- cleaned up some UI transitions</p><p>- updated envelope follower to include attack and release.</p><p>- pitch detector now shows the output as a musical note.</p><p>- fixed bug with expression/cv output wrapping around to negative.</p><p>- patch name no longer gets cut off in patch list.</p><p>- changed the name of cv absolute to cv rectify.</p><p>- added note view to cv value module</p><p>0.09 (November 23, 2018)</p><p>------------------------</p><p>- patch name is now added to filename when saved to sd card. the following characters</p><p>  are converted to underscore so filename always works: period, dash, and space. (thanks Pauline)</p><p>- fixed connection issue (thanks Mitch)</p><p>- fixed the curse of &quot;Patchesed&quot; (thanks ZH)</p><p>- changed references from &quot;presets&quot; to &quot;patches&quot;</p><p>- fixed module edit bug that was causing an edit to delay line to crash pedal. (thanks Patrick)</p><p>- fixed tap tempo in tremolo and delay effect.</p><p>- fixed bug with &quot;Startup state: engage&quot; where you had to hit bypass stomp twice</p><p>  to bypass</p><p>- fixed bug that causes oversampling in oscillator to not work correctly.</p><p>0.08 (November 19, 2018)</p><p>-----------------------</p><p>- update the following modules, which breaks them in presets:</p><p>    LFO, tremolo, and delay w/mod</p><p>- removed blinking cursor from renaming screen to fix the screen glitch</p><p>  and screen shift. Have had instances of screen glitch/shift after this</p><p>  change, but cant reliably reproduce it. If anyone can make this happen</p><p>  please let us know!</p><p>- added modules:</p><p>    - mixer module to audio out category. mixes two inputs with equal power.</p><p>    - bitwise modulation module to audio out category. Watch out, it's wild!</p><p>      Requires the two inputs to be at least slightly different, so a signal and</p><p>      it's slightly delayed self will work.</p><p>    - audio inverter to audio out category. Flips audio so the output is 180</p><p>      degrees out of phase with the input.</p><p>- fixed a number of issues with delay line: tap tempo, copying, editing options,</p><p>  more max delay time.</p><p>- fixed the editing of sampler module options.</p><p>- fixed df1 so that it's options can be properly edited.</p><p>- fixed the &quot;weird&quot; colour bug in module copy.</p><p>- fixed LFO trigger input.</p><p>- pitch shifter changed to follow 1 octave per 0.1</p><p>- configuration has options for engaged at startup, may mess with users</p><p>  existing settings.</p><p>- added factory reset in config options.</p><p>- oscillator can use oversampling now. takes up more computations but sounds better.</p><p>- can now delete patch from patch list.</p><p>- user is now informed when the SD card has been inserted the wrong way.</p><p>- fixed SD card so that it shouldn't hang in the middle of reading and writing</p><p>  presets on start up.</p><p>- fixed a bunch of UI transition bugs.</p><p>- in page list: now you can click on page to exit page list.</p><p>- page copy and move now copy and move to the correct location.</p><p>- fixed &quot;number of patches&quot; in config options.</p><p>- enabled bank mode patch system.</p><p>0.07 (November 8, 2018)</p><p>-----------------------</p><p>- added midi PC message functionality: if you set midi channel in config to X,</p><p>  pedal will change patches when you send in midi PC messages on channel X</p><p>- added midi CC#60 for engaging/bypassing pedal. value of 0 bypasses, 127 engages.</p><p>0.06 (November 8, 2018)</p><p>-----------------------</p><p>- fixed crazy distorted/ring-mod sound caused by delay w/mod module (we think).</p><p>- set screen napper to 1 hour. change implementation to hopefully reduce freezing.</p><p>- version number is now shown in the config menu.</p><p>- fixed bugs in modules: ui button</p><p>- fixed phantom glow issue</p><p>- fixed bug with options screen.</p><p>- fixed bug with patch naming.</p><p>- fixed bug with undo button freezing UI.</p><p>0.05 (November 2, 2018)</p><p>-----------------------</p><p>- fixed patch names in the patch list</p><p>- fixed bugs in modules: delay line, stompswitches, pushbutton</p><p>- fixed view button</p><p>- each jack saves it's view now</p><p>- can use capital letters to name</p>
