<p class="p2">*General*</p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">**What is ZOIA?** <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">- ZOIA is a modular synthesizer in a pedal designed by Empress Effects in Canada.</p>
<p class="p2">- A modular synthesizer uses modules as components in a larger system.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Each module has a specific function, and these functions can be combined in a multitude of ways to create just about anything you can dream up! This means ZOIA can be used as a straight guitar pedal with the built-in FX modules, or to create a synthesizer/sequencer, or to control other effects as a Midi controller, or to make an entire pedalboard in one patch.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And more! <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">- The major drawback of this sort of flexibility is that the devil is in the details.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Modular creation requires a level of detail that surpasses the traditional guitar pedal, so expect to spend lots of time tweaking your patches. Of course, you can rely on others to do the work for you by exploring the Patchstorage site and this subreddit. The goal is to embrace collaboration and to make the ZOIA as easy to use as possible.</p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">**When will [insert feature here] be added?** <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">- When it’s ready, and not a moment sooner</p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">**What power supply does ZOIA require? Does the unit come with a power supply?** <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">- ZOIA requires at least 300 mA at 9v, delivered by center negative plug.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A list of compatible power supplies can be found [here](http://assets.empresseffects.com/power.html). Other power supplies not found on the list may also work with ZOIA, provided they supply the necessary power requirements listed above (e.g., Strymon power supplies). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">- ZOIA does not come with a [power supply](https://www.instagram.com/p/CAF19TLlayi/?hl=en).</p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">**What microSD card does ZOIA use?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Does the unit come with one?** <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">- The card must be SDHC or SDXC specifically, and it must be formatted FAT32, with a single partition. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">- ZOIA ships with a microSD card and an SD card adapter.</p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">**I'm having an issue with my ZOIA.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What should I do?** <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">- While the subreddit may be able to help with something that you suspect is user error, if you think there is a *hardware* problem with your unit, please contact Empress support by filing a [support ticket](https://empresseffects.wufoo.com/forms/empress-effects-request-for-repair/) with Empress or by emailing support@empresseffects.com. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">- If you think you have identified a *bug*, also email support@empresseffects.com with "bug report" in the title.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Try to provide as much specific information as possible, and include the patch where you located the bug as an attachment to the email.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Before you send in a bug report, try to replicate the bug in a new patch, if possible; this will help rule out user error and make the circumstances where the bug occurs more clear. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">**Is there a patch that does X?** <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">- Most patches for ZOIA are circulated on [Patchstorage](https://patchstorage.com/platform/zoia/); this would be the place to check first. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">- You may also consider downloading the [ZOIA Librarian desktop app](https://github.com/meanmedianmoge/zoia_lib) as its search engine may suit you better than the one used by Patchstorage. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">**Can ZOIA replace [xyz]?** <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">- That entirely depends on your personal preferences and workflow. If you’re aiming to recreate pedals, consider finding an opportunity to compare them directly. Some circuits can be found online (Fairfield Circuitry is a great example of a builder who provides the diagrams in the manuals, and many manuals provide an explanation of how an effect is produced). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">- But a caveat should be made:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>ZOIA excels at approximation, but it fails at *exact* reproduction.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Well-known effects are the result of years of research and development specified to a singular task:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>digital effects are the result of finely-crafted algorithms and analog effects are the result of carefully-chosen components and circuit revisions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There will be differences; these are neither good nor bad (beyond one's own preference), but they are unavoidable. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">**I have an idea for improving ZOIA. How do I let Empress know about it?** <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">- Empress has an ideas forum for proposing new features. You can join by completing the registration process [here](https://empresseffects.com/idea-forum). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">- Once you join, please take a while to peruse the forum. Creating a new post for an existing request only hinders the potential for either to gain traction; instead, contribute to ongoing discussions on a topic where possible. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">**Should I upgrade my firmware?** <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">- This decision is entirely up to you. It is recommended that you read the changelogs found on the firmware upgrade page before making an upgrade, so that you know what features have been added.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Firmwares are tested to ensure patch functionality is maintained across versions. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Because ZOIA is in constant development, new firmwares may introduce new bugs, but they also squash existing bugs. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">**My screen went blank.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What do I do?** <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">- ZOIA has a built-in screensaver function that is enabled after one hour. To wake the screen, press one of the grid buttons. As of firmware 1.13, the screensaver will display instructions to wake the screen as well. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">*Inputs and outputs* <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">**Is ZOIA true bypass?** <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">- No, everything is converted to digital, even the bypassed signal. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">**Can I use the two inputs and outputs as separate channels?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Is there anything I should know about the inputs and outputs?** <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">- Yes, you can use these for entirely separate signal paths. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">- If nothing is placed in the right input, the left input will be copied to the right output when bypassed and can be used with a stereo audio input module to make a stereo signal from a mono source. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">- Individual outputs are TS and unbalanced. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">**What cables do I need to use MIDI with ZOIA?** <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">- While you can use a 1/8th"/3.5mm TRS cable with the MIDI ports, it must be connected to a device that supports TRS A MIDI protocol.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some devices (notably legacy products from Novation and Arturia but there are others) use TRS B, which is incompatible with TRS A. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">- If you are not sure what TRS MIDI protocol your device supports, it is best to use the adapters that came with ZOIA and a 5-pin MIDI cable. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">- You can also solder a TRS A to TRS B cable: https://www.midi.org/midi-articles/updated-how-to-make-your-own-3-5mm-mini-stereo-trs-to-midi-5-pin-din-cables</p>
<p class="p2">- And Retrokits sells a TRS A to TRS B cable:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>https://www.retrokits.com/shop/trsa-trsb/ <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">- The Cport can also be used to send and receive MIDI. In order to use the Cport in this manner, you must change the Cport setting in the config menu. Also, keep in mind (quoted from the ZOIA manual):<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Note that when the MIDI ports are in use, the Control Port will only be able to send MIDI out, and not accept MIDI in. Be sure to use a TRS connector instead of a standard TS patch cable if you wish to send MIDI messages from the ZOIA." <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">**What cables do I need to use CV with ZOIA?** <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">- ZOIA receives CV on the tip of a TRS plug connected to the Cport, and it sends CV on the ring.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In order to send and receive CV, you will need a TRS to dual TS adapter of some kind.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You will also likely need an adapter to step down from 1/4th"/6.5mm to 1/8th"/3.5 mm. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">- Also, make sure to change the Cport setting in the config menu to CV. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">*MIDI*</p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">**What's the difference between the MIDI channel setting and the starred MIDI channel setting in the config menu?** <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">- There are three ways to set MIDI channel specifications for ZOIA, and each covers a different circumstance. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">- The MIDI channel setting in the config menu is used exclusively for monitoring for program changes (PC) and bypass messages.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The default channel is 1. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">- The starred CC MIDI channel setting in the config menu determines what channel MIDI control controller (CC) assignments made through the starred parameter list will respond to.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The default channel is 1. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">- All other MIDI assignments are made within a patch, at the module level.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Each MIDI module (with the exception of clock, which is not channel-specific) can be assigned to its own MIDI channel and must be assigned if you wish to use the modules in the patch to send or receive MIDI on a channel other than the default, channel 1. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">**How do I set ZOIA's MIDI out to act as a...?** <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">- As of firmware 1.11, ZOIA's MIDI out port's behavior can be configured using the "MIDI consume" option in the config menu.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There are three options:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>some, all, or none. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">- Some = the original behavior; all MIDI is passed thru except that used within the current patch; all MIDI generated in the patch is passed to output. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">- All = no MIDI is passed through; all MIDI generated in the patch is passed to output (MIDI out behavior, essentially). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">- None = all MIDI is passed through along with all MIDI generated by the patch (MIDI thru behavior with any MIDI generated in the patch being merged to the MIDI stream). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">*Other*</p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">**I use synths and am interested in ZOIA, but all the demos I see seem to only use ZOIA with guitars // I'm a guitarist and am interested in ZOIA, but all the demos I see seem to only use ZOIA with synths.** <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">- Exchange search/view histories. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">- In all seriousness, ZOIA works with just about any sound source you can think of.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>People use it with guitars, synths, basses, saxophones, violins, vocals, piano, kalimba, probably kazoo at least once.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or it can generate its own tones. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">**What does the undo button do?** <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">- It displays a message that says "not yet implemented."<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Which can be useful, if you aren't sure how to spell implement.</p>
