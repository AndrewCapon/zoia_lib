<p>***</p><p>### **FAQ**</p><p>***</p><p>*General*</p><p>**What is ZOIA?**  </p><p>- ZOIA is a modular synthesizer in a pedal designed by Empress Effects in Canada.  </p><p>- A modular synthesizer uses modules as components in a larger system.  Each module has a specific function, and these functions can be combined in a multitude of ways to create just about anything you can dream up! This means ZOIA can be used as a straight guitar pedal with the built-in FX modules, or to create a synthesizer/sequencer, or to control other effects as a Midi controller, or to make an entire pedalboard in one patch.  And more!  </p><p>- The major drawback of this sort of flexibility is that the devil is in the details.  Modular creation requires a level of detail that surpasses the traditional guitar pedal, so expect to spend lots of time tweaking your patches. Of course, you can rely on others to do the work for you by exploring the Patchstorage site and this subreddit. The goal is to embrace collaboration and to make the ZOIA as easy to use as possible.<br /><br />**Is ZOIA too complicated for me?**</p><p>- Brace yourself:  it depends.</p><p>- At the most basic level, ZOIA's grid-based interface is something that is probably not familiar, and learning it requires a little re-orientation.  And some people just never click with that interface -- pobody's nerfect.</p><p>- Beyond that, the answer to this question really depends on what you want to get out of ZOIA and what you're willing to put into it.  </p><p>- If your plans are modest, and you just want to use the pre-built effects in ZOIA, then it's not much more complicated than many other multi-effects units, interface aside.  Digging deeper, it offers levels of customization that are not commonly found in similar units, thanks to its open design.</p><p>- If you want to invent some wild new effect or create a heuristic-driven sequencer, you may find ZOIA can be as complicated as your idea itself and figuring out how to realize that idea may take a lot of time and effort.</p><p>- There is a learning curve, but you can step off it at any point along the way and find something useful.</p><p>**When will [insert feature here] be added?**  </p><p>- When it’s ready, and not a moment sooner</p><p>**What power supply does ZOIA require? Does the unit come with a power supply?**  </p><p>- ZOIA requires at least 300 mA at 9v, delivered by center negative plug.  A list of compatible power supplies can be found [here](http://assets.empresseffects.com/power.html). Other power supplies not found on the list may also work with ZOIA, provided they supply the necessary power requirements listed above (e.g., Strymon power supplies).  </p><p>- ZOIA does not come with a [power supply](<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CAF19TLlayi/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/p/CAF19TLlayi/?hl=en</a>).</p><p>**What microSD card does ZOIA use?  Does the unit come with one?**  </p><p>- The card must be SDHC or SDXC specifically, and it must be formatted FAT32, with a single partition.  </p><p>- ZOIA ships with a microSD card and an SD card adapter.</p><p>**How many patches can ZOIA run at a time? What about banks?**  </p><p>- All ZOIA’s ship with 60 factory patches and 4 blank slots.</p><p>- Just a single patch can be run at a time. Due to the ZOIA’s open-endedness, this one patch can of course utilize multiple effects.</p><p>- ZOIA can store 64 patches as a “bank” for quick-access. There are scroll and bank modes on the stompswitches for moving through patches, and it also accepts MIDI PC messages for patch changing.</p><p>- Using an SD card, ZOIA can technically hold up to 4096 patches (64 banks * 64 patches each). However, only one of these banks can be loaded at a time. The bank loading/saving process takes about 15-30 seconds. There are currently no ways to automate bank changes via MIDI.</p><p>**What’s the deal with the filenames I see on my SD card?**  </p><p>- Before answering the question, see this link: <a href="https://github.com/meanmedianmoge/zoia_lib">https://github.com/meanmedianmoge/zoia_lib</a>. This application provides a graphical user interface for patch organization and many other useful functions for getting the best out of your ZOIA!</p><p>- ZOIA uses a unique pattern for its patches, namely “###_zoia_NAME.bin”. All parts of the filename are crucial for the device to properly load patches.</p><p>- ### represents a three digit integer, of which the ZOIA accepts 000 through 063 (ZOIA is 0-indexed so 000 is the first patch).</p><p>- _zoia_ represents the device name.</p><p>- NAME represents the name of the patch. This is equivalent to the name of the patch you decide to name it as, with underscores instead of spaces.</p><p>- .bin is the file format used. ZOIA does not currently accept any other file formats.</p><p>- It is important to be familiar with patch name requirements because you’ll likely need to make edits to these filenames while managing your SD card directories. Patches with improper names will not be loaded into the device, as it cannot read them.</p><p>**How do I load and save patches onto my ZOIA?**  </p><p>- Saving patches can be done in 2 ways.</p><p>- The first way is by using the Shift + Save key; this will save the current patch to memory (not to SD!).</p><p>- The second way is to use the “Patches to SD” item in the config menu, which loads all 64 patches in the current bank to a directory on your SD card.</p><p>- Patches saved to memory (not to SD!) remain in memory even upon power-down. Upon loading a new bank, the previous patches are saved to the backup directory on your SD card. This backup includes all prior in-memory banks and serves as a safety measure in case you accidentally write over patches which you have yet to export to a dedicated SD directory.</p><p>- Loading patches is done via the config menu, using the “Patches from SD” item. This process will overwrite the current bank of patches with all non-blank slots in the directory you select. For example, if slot 25 is empty in the directory you’re loading, slot 25 will remain as it is in the current (outgoing) bank.</p><p>**I'm having an issue with my ZOIA.  What should I do?**  </p><p>- While the subreddit may be able to help with something that you suspect is user error, if you think there is a *hardware* problem with your unit, please contact Empress support by filing a [support ticket](https://empresseffects.wufoo.com/forms/empress-effects-request-for-repair/) with Empress or by emailing support@empresseffects.com.  </p><p>- If you think you have identified a *bug*, also email support@empresseffects.com with &quot;bug report&quot; in the title.  Try to provide as much specific information as possible, and include the patch where you located the bug as an attachment to the email.  Before you send in a bug report, try to replicate the bug in a new patch, if possible; this will help rule out user error and make the circumstances where the bug occurs more clear.  </p><p>**Is there a patch that does X?**  </p><p>- Most patches for ZOIA are circulated on [Patchstorage](https://patchstorage.com/platform/zoia/); this would be the place to check first.  </p><p>- You may also consider downloading the [ZOIA Librarian desktop app](https://github.com/meanmedianmoge/zoia_lib) as its search engine may suit you better than the one used by Patchstorage.  </p><p>**Can ZOIA replace [xyz]?**  </p><p>- That entirely depends on your personal preferences and workflow. If you’re aiming to recreate pedals, consider finding an opportunity to compare them directly. Some circuits can be found online (Fairfield Circuitry is a great example of a builder who provides the diagrams in the manuals, and many manuals provide an explanation of how an effect is produced).  </p><p>- But a caveat should be made:  ZOIA excels at approximation, but it fails at *exact* reproduction.  Well-known effects are the result of years of research and development specified to a singular task:  digital effects are the result of finely-crafted algorithms and analog effects are the result of carefully-chosen components and circuit revisions.  There will be differences; these are neither good nor bad (beyond one's own preference), but they are unavoidable.  </p><p>**I downloaded a patch from Patchstorage that runs at 102%.  Will my ZOIA explode?**<br />- Patches can use up to 105% of the CPU.<br />- If a patch goes above this limit, you will hear the CPU clipping:  some of the audio will be dropped and produce crackles; controls may be sluggish; the CPU may freeze -- this is represented on ZOIA by the utility buttons turning yellow -- and stop producing audio altogether.  CPU clipping also affects MIDI and CV, although this may be less apparent at the onset of clipping.</p><p>**I have an idea for improving ZOIA. How do I let Empress know about it?**  </p><p>- Empress has an ideas forum for proposing new features. You can join by completing the registration process [here](https://empresseffects.com/idea-forum).  </p><p>- Once you join, please take a while to peruse the forum. Creating a new post for an existing request only hinders the potential for either to gain traction; instead, contribute to ongoing discussions on a topic where possible.  </p><p>**Should I upgrade my firmware?**  </p><p>- This decision is entirely up to you. It is recommended that you read the changelogs found on the firmware upgrade page before making an upgrade, so that you know what features have been added.  Firmwares are tested to ensure patch functionality is maintained across versions.   Because ZOIA is in constant development, new firmwares may introduce new bugs, but they also squash existing bugs.  </p><p>**My screen went blank.  What do I do?**  </p><p>- ZOIA has a built-in screensaver function that is enabled after one hour. To wake the screen, press one of the grid buttons. As of firmware 1.13, the screensaver will display instructions to wake the screen as well.  </p><p>*Inputs and outputs*  </p><p>**Is ZOIA true bypass?**  </p><p>- No, everything is converted to digital, even the bypassed signal.  </p><p>**Can I use the two inputs and outputs as separate channels?  Is there anything I should know about the inputs and outputs?**  </p><p>- Yes, you can use these for entirely separate signal paths.  </p><p>- If nothing is placed in the right input, the left input will be copied to the right output when bypassed and can be used with a stereo audio input module to make a stereo signal from a mono source.  </p><p>- Individual outputs are TS and unbalanced.  </p><p>**What cables do I need to use MIDI with ZOIA?**  </p><p>- While you can use a 1/8th&quot;/3.5mm TRS cable with the MIDI ports, it must be connected to a device that supports TRS A MIDI protocol.  Some devices (notably legacy products from Novation and Arturia but there are others) use TRS B, which is incompatible with TRS A.  </p><p>- If you are not sure what TRS MIDI protocol your device supports, it is best to use the adapters that came with ZOIA and a 5-pin MIDI cable.  </p><p>- You can also solder a TRS A to TRS B cable: https://www.midi.org/midi-articles/updated-how-to-make-your-own-3-5mm-mini-stereo-trs-to-midi-5-pin-din-cables</p><p>- And Retrokits sells a TRS A to TRS B cable:  https://www.retrokits.com/shop/trsa-trsb/  </p><p>- The Cport can also be used to send and receive MIDI. In order to use the Cport in this manner, you must change the Cport setting in the config menu. Also, keep in mind (quoted from the ZOIA manual):  &quot;Note that when the MIDI ports are in use, the Control Port will only be able to send MIDI out, and not accept MIDI in. Be sure to use a TRS connector instead of a standard TS patch cable if you wish to send MIDI messages from the ZOIA.&quot;  </p><p>- If your MIDI device does not have a 5-pin or TRS MIDI output, but rather uses a USB MIDI output, you will need a MIDI host to connect it to ZOIA.  Loopop has an excellent explainer video on USB MIDI hosts:  https://youtu.be/neXswJJcatc</p><p>**What cables do I need to use CV with ZOIA?**  </p><p>- ZOIA receives CV on the tip of a TRS plug connected to the Cport, and it sends CV on the ring.  In order to send and receive CV, you will need a TRS to dual TS adapter of some kind.  You will also likely need an adapter to step down from 1/4th&quot;/6.5mm to 1/8th&quot;/3.5 mm.  </p><p>- Also, make sure to change the Cport setting in the config menu to CV.  </p><p>*MIDI*</p><p>**What's the difference between the MIDI channel setting and the starred MIDI channel setting in the config menu?**  </p><p>- There are three ways to set MIDI channel specifications for ZOIA, and each covers a different circumstance.  </p><p>- The MIDI channel setting in the config menu is used exclusively for monitoring for program changes (PC) and bypass messages.  The default channel is 1.  </p><p>- The starred CC MIDI channel setting in the config menu determines what channel MIDI control controller (CC) assignments made through the starred parameter list will respond to.  The default channel is 1.  </p><p>- All other MIDI assignments are made within a patch, at the module level.  Each MIDI module (with the exception of clock, which is not channel-specific) can be assigned to its own MIDI channel and must be assigned if you wish to use the modules in the patch to send or receive MIDI on a channel other than the default, channel 1.  </p><p>**How do I set ZOIA's MIDI out to act as a...?**  </p><p>- As of firmware 1.11, ZOIA's MIDI out port's behavior can be configured using the &quot;MIDI consume&quot; option in the config menu.  There are three options:  some, all, or none.  </p><p>- Some = the original behavior; all MIDI is passed thru except that used within the current patch; all MIDI generated in the patch is passed to output.  </p><p>- All = no MIDI is passed through; all MIDI generated in the patch is passed to output (MIDI out behavior, essentially).  </p><p>- None = all MIDI is passed through along with all MIDI generated by the patch (MIDI thru behavior with any MIDI generated in the patch being merged to the MIDI stream).  </p><p>**Are there any global CC messages?**  </p><p>- Yes, there is bypass (64) and expression (10) over MIDI. More CC messages can be customized per patch using the starred parameters MIDI learn function.</p><p>*Other*</p><p>**I use synths and am interested in ZOIA, but all the demos I see seem to only use ZOIA with guitars // I'm a guitarist and am interested in ZOIA, but all the demos I see seem to only use ZOIA with synths.**  </p><p>- Exchange search/view histories.  </p><p>- In all seriousness, ZOIA works with just about any sound source you can think of.  People use it with guitars, synths, basses, saxophones, violins, vocals, piano, kalimba, probably kazoo at least once.  Or it can generate its own tones.  </p><p>**No one asked this, but what's the correct mode of address for others in the ZOIA community?**</p><p>- We are ZOIAns, one and all.</p><p>**What does the undo button do?**  </p><p>- It displays a message that says &quot;not yet implemented.&quot;  Which can be useful, if you aren't sure how to spell implement.</p>
