<p><em>General</em></p><p><strong>What is ZOIA?</strong></p><p>- ZOIA is a modular synthesizer in a pedal designed by Empress Effects in Canada. - A modular synthesizer uses modules as components in a larger system. Each module has a specific function, and these functions can be combined in a multitude of ways to create just about anything you can dream up! This means ZOIA can be used as a straight guitar pedal with the built-in FX modules, or to create a synthesizer/sequencer, or to control other effects as a Midi controller, or to make an entire pedalboard in one patch. And more!</p><p>- The major drawback of this sort of flexibility is that the devil is in the details. Modular creation requires a level of detail that surpasses the traditional guitar pedal, so expect to spend lots of time tweaking your patches. Of course, you can rely on others to do the work for you by exploring the Patchstorage site and this subreddit. The goal is to embrace collaboration and to make the ZOIA as easy to use as possible.</p><p><strong>When will [insert feature here] be added?</strong></p><p>- When it’s ready, and not a moment sooner</p><p><strong>What power supply does ZOIA require? Does the unit come with a power supply?</strong></p><p>- ZOIA requires at least 300 mA at 9v, delivered by center negative plug. A list of compatible power supplies can be found<a href="http://assets.empresseffects.com/power.html"> here</a>. Other power supplies not found on the list may also work with ZOIA, provided they supply the necessary power requirements listed above (e.g., Strymon power supplies).</p><p>- ZOIA does not come with a<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CAF19TLlayi/?hl=en"> power supply</a></p><p>.</p><p><strong>What microSD card does ZOIA use? Does the unit come with one?</strong></p><p>- The card must be SDHC or SDXC specifically, and it must be formatted FAT32, with a single partition.</p><p>- ZOIA ships with a microSD card and an SD card adapter.</p><p><strong>I'm having an issue with my ZOIA. What should I do?</strong></p><p>- While the subreddit may be able to help with something that you suspect is user error, if you think there is a <em>hardware</em> problem with your unit, please contact Empress support by filing a<a href="https://empresseffects.wufoo.com/forms/empress-effects-request-for-repair/"> support ticket</a> with Empress or by emailing support@empresseffects.com.</p><p>- If you think you have identified a <em>bug</em>, also email support@empresseffects.com with &quot;bug report&quot; in the title. Try to provide as much specific information as possible, and include the patch where you located the bug as an attachment to the email. Before you send in a bug report, try to replicate the bug in a new patch, if possible; this will help rule out user error and make the circumstances where the bug occurs more clear.</p><p><strong>Is there a patch that does X?</strong></p><p>- Most patches for ZOIA are circulated on<a href="https://patchstorage.com/platform/zoia/"> Patchstorage</a>; this would be the place to check first.</p><p>- You may also consider downloading the<a href="https://github.com/meanmedianmoge/zoia_lib"> ZOIA Librarian desktop app</a> as its search engine may suit you better than the one used by Patchstorage.</p><p><strong>Can ZOIA replace [xyz]?</strong></p><p>- That entirely depends on your personal preferences and workflow. If you’re aiming to recreate pedals, consider finding an opportunity to compare them directly. Some circuits can be found online (Fairfield Circuitry is a great example of a builder who provides the diagrams in the manuals, and many manuals provide an explanation of how an effect is produced).</p><p>- But a caveat should be made: ZOIA excels at approximation, but it fails at <em>exact</em> reproduction. Well-known effects are the result of years of research and development specified to a singular task: digital effects are the result of finely-crafted algorithms and analog effects are the result of carefully-chosen components and circuit revisions. There will be differences; these are neither good nor bad (beyond one's own preference), but they are unavoidable.</p><p><strong>I have an idea for improving ZOIA. How do I let Empress know about it?</strong></p><p>- Empress has an ideas forum for proposing new features. You can join by completing the registration process<a href="https://empresseffects.com/idea-forum"> here</a>.</p><p>- Once you join, please take a while to peruse the forum. Creating a new post for an existing request only hinders the potential for either to gain traction; instead, contribute to ongoing discussions on a topic where possible.</p><p><strong>Should I upgrade my firmware?</strong></p><p>- This decision is entirely up to you. It is recommended that you read the changelogs found on the firmware upgrade page before making an upgrade, so that you know what features have been added. Firmwares are tested to ensure patch functionality is maintained across versions. Because ZOIA is in constant development, new firmwares may introduce new bugs, but they also squash existing bugs.</p><p><strong>My screen went blank. What do I do?</strong></p><p>- ZOIA has a built-in screensaver function that is enabled after one hour. To wake the screen, press one of the grid buttons. As of firmware 1.13, the screensaver will display instructions to wake the screen as well.</p><p><em>Inputs and outputs</em></p><p><strong>Is ZOIA true bypass?</strong></p><p>- No, everything is converted to digital, even the bypassed signal.</p><p><strong>Can I use the two inputs and outputs as separate channels? Is there anything I should know about the inputs and outputs?</strong></p><p>- Yes, you can use these for entirely separate signal paths.</p><p>- If nothing is placed in the right input, the left input will be copied to the right output when bypassed and can be used with a stereo audio input module to make a stereo signal from a mono source.</p><p>- Individual outputs are TS and unbalanced.</p><p><strong>What cables do I need to use MIDI with ZOIA?</strong></p><p>- While you can use a 1/8th&quot;/3.5mm TRS cable with the MIDI ports, it must be connected to a device that supports TRS A MIDI protocol. Some devices (notably legacy products from Novation and Arturia but there are others) use TRS B, which is incompatible with TRS A.</p><p>- If you are not sure what TRS MIDI protocol your device supports, it is best to use the adapters that came with ZOIA and a 5-pin MIDI cable.</p><p>- You can also solder a TRS A to TRS B cable:<a href="https://www.midi.org/midi-articles/updated-how-to-make-your-own-3-5mm-mini-stereo-trs-to-midi-5-pin-din-cables"> https://www.midi.org/midi-articles/updated-how-to-make-your-own-3-5mm-mini-stereo-trs-to-midi-5-pin-din-cables</a> - And Retrokits sells a TRS A to TRS B cable:<a href="https://www.retrokits.com/shop/trsa-trsb/"> https://www.retrokits.com/shop/trsa-trsb/</a></p><p>- The Cport can also be used to send and receive MIDI. In order to use the Cport in this manner, you must change the Cport setting in the config menu. Also, keep in mind (quoted from the ZOIA manual): &quot;Note that when the MIDI ports are in use, the Control Port will only be able to send MIDI out, and not accept MIDI in. Be sure to use a TRS connector instead of a standard TS patch cable if you wish to send MIDI messages from the ZOIA.&quot;</p><p><strong>What cables do I need to use CV with ZOIA?</strong></p><p>- ZOIA receives CV on the tip of a TRS plug connected to the Cport, and it sends CV on the ring. In order to send and receive CV, you will need a TRS to dual TS adapter of some kind. You will also likely need an adapter to step down from 1/4th&quot;/6.5mm to 1/8th&quot;/3.5 mm.</p><p>- Also, make sure to change the Cport setting in the config menu to CV.</p><p><em>MIDI</em></p><p><strong>What's the difference between the MIDI channel setting and the starred MIDI channel setting in the config menu?</strong></p><p>- There are three ways to set MIDI channel specifications for ZOIA, and each covers a different circumstance.</p><p>- The MIDI channel setting in the config menu is used exclusively for monitoring for program changes (PC) and bypass messages. The default channel is 1.</p><p>- The starred CC MIDI channel setting in the config menu determines what channel MIDI control controller (CC) assignments made through the starred parameter list will respond to. The default channel is 1.</p><p>- All other MIDI assignments are made within a patch, at the module level. Each MIDI module (with the exception of clock, which is not channel-specific) can be assigned to its own MIDI channel and must be assigned if you wish to use the modules in the patch to send or receive MIDI on a channel other than the default, channel 1.</p><p><strong>How do I set ZOIA's MIDI out to act as a...?</strong></p><p>- As of firmware 1.11, ZOIA's MIDI out port's behavior can be configured using the &quot;MIDI consume&quot; option in the config menu. There are three options: some, all, or none.</p><p>- Some = the original behavior; all MIDI is passed thru except that used within the current patch; all MIDI generated in the patch is passed to output.</p><p>- All = no MIDI is passed through; all MIDI generated in the patch is passed to output (MIDI out behavior, essentially).</p><p>- None = all MIDI is passed through along with all MIDI generated by the patch (MIDI thru behavior with any MIDI generated in the patch being merged to the MIDI stream).</p><p><em>Other</em></p><p><strong>I use synths and am interested in ZOIA, but all the demos I see seem to only use ZOIA with guitars // I'm a guitarist and am interested in ZOIA, but all the demos I see seem to only use ZOIA with synths.</strong></p><p>- Exchange search/view histories.</p><p>- In all seriousness, ZOIA works with just about any sound source you can think of. People use it with guitars, synths, basses, saxophones, violins, vocals, piano, kalimba, probably kazoo at least once. Or it can generate its own tones.</p><p><strong>What does the undo button do?</strong></p><p>- It displays a message that says &quot;not yet implemented.&quot; Which can be useful, if you aren't sure how to spell implement.</p>
