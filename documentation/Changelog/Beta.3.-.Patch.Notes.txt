ZOIA Librarian - Beta 3

**** PATCH NOTES ****

New Features
- Added an early implementation of a patch visualizer. Massive thanks to apparent1 for the initial C#
  implementation, and special thanks to chmjacques and meanmedianmoge for helping with the binary 
  analysis. This is a feature that will grow in the future and may eventually turn into a full patch
  editor (absolutely zero promises there).
- The application now works offline! However, you won't be able to access the PatchStorage View tab while
  offline. May require a restart to detect an internet connection.
- Added the ability to download all patches from PatchStorage (via a suggestion from Steve, thanks Steve!)
- Added threading support to processes that would stall the application (such as importing, checking for
  updates, and refreshing the PatchStorage patch list).
- Added some more style tweaks to the Windows version of Beta 3. 
- Optimizations to have the Librarian run smoother and better than Beta 2. Take that Beta 2! 
  Nobody downloaded you anyway.
- Added the ability to download patches that use the .rar compression algorithm. This will only work if
  you have WinRAR installed on your computer. 

Fixes
- Fixed a error that occured when trying to import a version history that contained more than 10 patches 
  (thanks chmjacques and meanmedianmoge!)
- Fixed an exporting error that would result in a popup saying an export was successful even if the user
  cancelled out of the export. 
- Fixed an isue when the application is launched for the first time and tables would not retain their
  specified sizes. 
- Fixed sorting order not being maintained after a search.
- Fixed an issue with Bank saving (it actually works now). 
- Remade the logo and splash screen using a clearer ZOIA logo.

Futrue Plans
- Expanding on the patch visualizer with more info, having the length of modules be correctly represented,
  and the ability to view connections between modules. 
- Improving the patch preview widget to make it look nicer and not like a giant wall of text. 
- Anything else the community wants to see implemented!


As always, we welcome any feedback you may have. Thanks for being awesome :)

As an aside, with the release of Beta 3, my time working on the ZOIA Librarian has come to an end. I'm really
proud of the current state of the ZOIA Librarian and had a blast working on it. 
I hope you all enjoy using it and that it continues to grow with new features to help out the ZOIA community.
