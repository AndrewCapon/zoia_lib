Version 1.0 (September 25, 2020)

New Features
- Finalized ZOIA binary parsing implementation. Again, massive thanks to djigneo/apparent1 for the initial C# code. As of this release, all features of the patch are fully exposed and can be decoded into a JSON object for further use.
- Patch visualizer has been updated with more information to help you understand patches at a quick-glance.
- Added the ability to search and sort for patches by author name.
    - This applies to Local and Bank tabs only
    - PS tab author search and sort will not be supported at this time due to the API structure.
- Updated patch importing so that patches with near-identical names are merged upon import (instead of strictly identical names).
- Updated the behavior of the SD and Bank tables so that multiples can be selected and moved in different ways:
    - Hold Shift and click the start and end patches to move.
    - Hold Ctrl/Cmd and click on each patch you'd like to move.
- Patches can now be moved into a bank in the following ways:
    - Dragging single or multiple selections (similar options as above) at once.
    - Include an Add to Bank button for single selections at a time.
- Added a Clear Bank button to wipe the bank tables clean.
- Added a new Help toolbar which allows users to access documentation and useful ZOIA resources. These will display in the PS tab browser panel. You can also search for different commands/shortcuts.
- Added a Reset UI menu option in the event that users mangle the UI panels or tables.
- The application will now start in dark mode by default. Also changed the light theme colors.
- Alternating row colors is now a saved preference. It will save whatever is the current setting upon closing the application.
- Added a step-by-step guide for how to compile the application from source for developers, contributors or users who were unable to open the beta builds.
- Added our first Linux build! We aim to support the latest stable version of Ubuntu going forward. If you are a Linux user who prefers other distributions, please contact me.

Fixes
- Fixed an issue that occurred while importing a version history (Mac).
- Removed the threads used with menu action multi-import functions (Mac temporary fix).
- Fixed an issue where the dates of imported patches were back-dated to the history of the SD card.
- Fixed an issue with SD card imported files having mangled filenames (Windows). This also caused patches to not export properly.
- Fixed an issue where changing the font/font size didn't apply to themes or buttons.

Known Issues
- Certain patch binaries cannot be fully decoded due to being saved on deprecated ZOIA firmware.
- Saved UI preferences are not being applied correctly for the Local Storage tab - specifically the vertical splitter (Mac).

Future Plans
- Expansion view of routing for patch visualizer. Right now, the connections are displayed on a module-block level, but not from a general patch level. The expander would provide an in-depth visualization of audio and CV routing, likely to be displayed in a new tab.
- Extend the binary decoder methods into an API for other applications/programs to utilize.
- Simplify and automate code structure for releases (currently, a minimal-working version of the code needs to be created for the app-building process).
- Allow for custom themes/colors in the UI.
- Actually fix threading issues associated with menu action multi-imports.

As always, we welcome any feedback you may have. Thanks for being awesome :)
