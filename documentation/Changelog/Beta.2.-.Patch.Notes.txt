ZOIA Librarian - Beta 2

**** PATCH NOTES ****

New Features
- The ZOIA Librarian will now save application settings on close. Did you hate having to resize the tables constantly?
  Probably. Now you just need to resize once and be done with it! Additional settings that are saved include the size
  of the window, the font and font size, the SD card (should it have been specified) and whether dark mode is enabled.
- Speaking of font saving, you can now change the font and font size used throughout the application. Check it out in
  the options menu.
- Also speaking of dark mode, yup, there's a dark mode now. Check it out in the options menu. 
  (What do you mean nobody asked for this?) 
- Added early support for imported directories to be treated as versions in the ZOIA Librarian. 
  More features surrounding this will be included in Beta 3.
- Added some styling to the application to make it less bland.
- Added keyboard shortcuts to all menu items.
- Added the ability to delete items off of an SD card from within the ZOIA Librarian. 
- Added a check that will try to detect if a patch you are importing is currently hosted on PatchStorage. If it is,
  the tags, categories, and patch notes will be retrieved when the patch is imported (Thanks Ch3ryl)!
  (note this won't work 100% of the time, the patch must be named the same as the entry on PatchStorage).
- Added the ability to drag/drop multiple patches in the SD card tables and bank tables. Now, organizing banks/sd 
  card folders can be done faster than ever!
- Added accessibility text throughout the application.

Fixes
- The "Load Bank" button will not be enabled if there are no banks saved once the user launches the application.
- Fixed the issue where updating the patch notes added a blank line at the start. The update patch notes button 
  is sorry. (It's okay update patch notes button, we forgive you).
- Fixed the case where loading/exporting a bank that had a patch that was deleted from the ZOIA Librarian caused 
  a crash. Now, a message box will inform the user of such occurances, and in the case of exporting, 
  will also specify which patches failed to export.
- Fixed some message boxes failing to display the application logo.
- Fixed the layout of the Bank tab so that the user does not need to drag a patch as far as before to add it to a 
  Bank.
- Fixed a bug with the Banks tables where if a user dragged patch and released it between two rows the table would 
  occasionally make new phantom rows.
- Fixed an issue with importing where the ### prefix would be imported in the _zoia_ prefix was missing from a patch 
  (Thanks markcrosbie!)
- Fixed an issue where if a bank had multiple of the same patch and a user tried to delete the one that occured later 
  in the slot list, the wrong patch would be deleted from the bank (currently a Windows only fix).
- Fixed an issue with file names that contained "." in their name before the extension.
- Fixed importing failing if the directory contained any "."s in its name (thanks chmjacques!)
- Fixed an issue where views would be counted multiple times in one session.
- Fixed an error that would "allow" a patch to be exporting even if an SD card was not inserted into the computer.
- Addressed the case where a user deletes the second to last patch in a Version History such that they are now sent 
  back to the main local patch overview (thanks meanmedianmoge)!
- Added multiple new popups to confirm when actions have finished processing.

Plans for Beta 3
- Making the application feel a lot more responsive (no more freezing while trying to look for patch updates).
- Adding a patch visualizer (very hush hush right now, please stay tuned).
- Improving the patch preview to have it include images and generally style it more like a website rather than
  a wall of text.
- Some low-level optimizations to make it so the application starts faster.


As always, we welcome any feedback you may have. Thanks for being awesome :)
