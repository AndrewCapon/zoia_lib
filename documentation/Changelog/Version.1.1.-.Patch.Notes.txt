Version 1.1 (February 2021)

New Features
- The visualizer panel has received a few organizational tweaks, including:
    Calculated and displayed the correct number of blocks per module.
    Listed the actual parameter names (with their values scaled from 0 to 1).
    Adjusted the connection text.
    Included a reset button to zoom out of the module-view.
- Local patches can now be rated on a scale of 0-5 stars.
    This also includes a new sorting and filtering method, found in the Sort toolbar.
    The first time you load v1.1 may take a bit longer than usual, since each patch downloaded or imported needs a rating field.
    If you haven't used the app before v1.1, load time will also be a bit long (on first startup) due to setting the local backend.
- Smoothed out transitions between app versions so that you no longer need to delete pref.json before running.
- Version histories can now be exported as a group using the "Export Patches" button.
    The original functionality (individual exports of versions) still exists in the version history view.
- Added the ability to set the directory where patches are exported from the Local Storage tab.
    The default directory is still "to_zoia" if you do not wish to change it.
    This option is set by a new button the SD tab (also the buttons here were adjusted slightly).
- The export patch dialog will default to the next-available open slot in the directory chosen.
    Also, if you attempt to overwrite a slot, it will display the name of the patch currently in that slot.
- Extended the search functionality to peek into version histories.
    Results that meet the query will display the version name, not the patch name.
- Updated the pop-up window that occurs if patches fail to import.
    It displays the name of the version history / patch so you can inspect it in Local Storage.
- Updated the module index and binary decoder to fw 1.14 spec.
- You can now sort by author in the PS tab.
    Unfortunately, PS-tab author search is not available.
- Adjusted the status and tool tip display text and keymap for shortcuts.
- Updated the default UI panel and table sizes to be more functional at startup.
- Changed some of the button names and style.
- Applied an autoformatter to the codebase to make it more readable and writable.
- Mac build is now confirmed to work with the .app file.
    No more needing to run from terminal! (credit: smithrobs)

Fixes
- Fixed an issue where BigSur dependency issues were causing the app to not load (Mac).
- Fixed an issue where choosing a SD card from the SD tab would cause the UI to snap to the Local Storage tab.

- Fixed an issue with the Local Storage splitter loading to a value other than the default or saved preferences (Mac).
- Fixed an issue with temp directories being created would override the patch list in the Local Storage tab.
- Replaced duplicate CV Filter module in mod index and viz code; CV Inverts should appear now.

Known Issues
- RAR-compressed files cannot be downloaded on Mac (as of this writing, this affects 1 patch - ZoiaMurf v2).
    Due to RAR's licensing, we cannot include a version of the RAR compression algorithm, nor can we verify that the user's machine has the algo installed.
    A workaround for this is to download the patch(es) separately on the PS site, and then import the binary file to the app.
    Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause.
- Occassionally, drag-and-drop will cease to work if you have an SD card location selected.
    Resetting the SD location and/or rebooting the app should mitigate the issue.
    It is being looked into (it's quite a tricky bug to diagnose...).

Future Plans
- Continue working on a Patch Expander tab.
    It was originally slotted for release in v1.1, but is now pushed to v1.2 due to complexity.
    The intent is to allow users to see the full audio and CV routings for a given patch as a whole.
- Official app store support for macOS and iPadOS versions.
    These specific versions will not be released under the GPL license, nor be made open-source due to Apple's development terms.
    However, the application in general will remain open-source and continue to be hosted on GitHub.

As always, we welcome any feedback you may have. Thanks for being awesome :)
