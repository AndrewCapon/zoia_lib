Version 1.1 (February 2021)

New Features
- The visualizer panel has received a few upgrades, including:
    - Calculate and display the correct number of blocks per module.
    - List the actual parameter names, with their values scaled from 0 to 1.
    - Adjust the connection text to be more readable.
    - Add a reset button to zoom out of a module-view (displays the patch-level data in the text window without needing to change pages).
- Local patches can be rated on a scale of 0-5 stars.
    - This feature also includes a new sorting and filtering method, found in the Sort toolbar.
    - The first time you run v1.1 may take a bit longer than usual, since each patch downloaded or imported needs a new rating field.
- The app is now versioned properly so that you no longer need to delete your saved preferences before upgrading.
- Version histories can be exported as a group using the “Export Patches” button in Local Storage.
    - The original functionality (individual exports of versions) still exists in the version history view.
- The export directory (used for exports from Local Storage) is user-definable, using the new “Set Export Directory” button in the SD Card tab.
    - If you do not define a directory, the default remains as “to_zoia”.
- The export patch dialog will default to the next-available open slot in the directory chosen.
    - Also, if you attempt to overwrite a slot, it will display the name of the patch currently in that slot.
- Searches will extend into version history information.
    - However, results that meet the query will display the version name, not the individual patch.
- The patch import dialog has been updated to display the name of the patch(es) which failed to import.
- ZOIA got an update, so the app will reflect those changes during binary decoding.
- UI updates, including:
    - Tooltip and status tip text
    - Shortcut keymaps
    - Default panel sizes
    - Button names and style
- General code upkeep: applied a fancy auto-formatter to the codebase and automated the app-bundling process.

Fixex
- Fixed an issue where BigSur dependency issues were causing the app to not load (Mac).
- Fixed an issue where choosing an SD card from the SD tab would cause the UI to snap to the Local Storage tab (credit: smithrobs).
- Fixed an issue where temp directories would overwrite the patch list in the Local Storage tab, causing it to appear like you had no patches downloaded.
- Mac build is now confirmed to work with the .app file. No more needing to run from the terminal (credit: smithrobs)!

Known Issues
- RAR-compressed files cannot be downloaded on Mac (as of this writing, this affects 1 patch - ZOIA Murf v2).
    - Due to RAR’s licensing, we cannot include a version of the compression algorithm, nor can we verify that the user’s machine has the algo installed.
    - A workaround for this is to download the RAR patch(es) separately on PatchStorage, and then import the binary file to the app.
    - We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.
- Occasionally, drag-and-drop will cease to work if you have an SD card location selected.
    - Resetting the SD location and/or rebooting the app should mitigate the issue. It is currently being looked into (quite a tricky bug to diagnose..).

Future Plans
- An iPadOS version is coming soon!
    - There are no plans for an Android release at this time.
- Continue working on a Patch Expander tab.
    - This was originally planned for v1.1, but is now pushed to v1.2 due to added complexity.
    - The intent is to allow users to see the full audio and CV routing for a given patch as a whole.

As always, we welcome any feedback you may have. Thanks for being awesome :)
